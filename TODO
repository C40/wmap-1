# The following improvements would be nice to have:


1. Add unit test cases for all major modules / classes (Note: Jan. 2015, Wmap::Utils module unit tests added).
2. Add Google search capability (Note: Oct. 2013, partial done, need Google API licensing /fee in order for the full implementation test. )
3. Better documentations / man pages for executables / operation manuals, in addition to the 'README' and 'rdoc'
4. Port the local data repository to a relational DB (for support of multi user sessions in the future)
5. Implement a RoR web interface for better user experience. 
6. Implement a report engine for better metric reporting. 
7. Improve the crawler, such as supporting link extraction in AJAX, FLASH and other rich HTML5 format
8. Improve the build-in port scanner 'wscan'. So it could eventually replace 'nmap' in the larget scale network blocks scanning process. 
9. Add vulnerability scanner engine.
10.Add vulnerability life cycle management.
